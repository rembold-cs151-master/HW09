# Homework 9
![](https://github.com/<user_info>/workflows/Autotesting/badge.svg)

Assignment Status: PENDING

_Please change the above to DONE when you finish and want the assignment to be graded!_

Due the night of April 10 at midnight!


## Instructions
The homework pdf has the basic instructions, and you should definitely read the docstrings, but here are some additional guidelines:
 - [ ] Read through the docstrings before getting started! They have important information!
 - [ ] Add code to the template functions in `Prob1.py` to encrypt and decode messages!

__Remember to fill out the commented metadata at the top of each Python script!__

#### Testing
 - Autotests are written for pretty much all the methods and functions, so you should be able to get a good idea if you are doing everything correctly. Don't hesitate to contact me to ask questions though if something is going weird!
