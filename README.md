## Instructions
The homework pdf has the basic instructions, and you should definitely read the docstrings, but here are some additional guidelines:
 - [ ] Read through the docstrings before getting started! They have important information!
 - [ ] Add code to the template functions in `Prob1.py` to encrypt and decode messages!
 - [ ] Add code to the template functions in `Prob2.py` to create a glorious population of rabbits, each with a unique id.

__Remember to fill out the commented metadata at the top of each Python script!__

 - Testing is still to come, and this repository will automatically be updated with it when it is available.
