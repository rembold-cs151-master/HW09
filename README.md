Assignment Status: PENDING

_Please change the above to DONE when you finish and want the assignment to be graded!_

Due the night of Nov 8 at midnight


## Instructions
The homework pdf has the basic instructions, and you should definitely read the docstrings, but here are some additional guidelines:
 - [ ] Make sure you remember to upload a pdf again on this assignment, as Problem 1 has written work.
 - [ ] Read through the docstrings before getting started! They have important information!
 - [ ] Add code to the template functions in `Prob2.py` to create the word game!
 	- [ ] Any time a guessed word is passed to a function in `Prob2.py`, you should account for the possibility that it might have mixed upper and lower case and correct it accordingly.

__Remember to fill out the commented metadata at the top of each Python script!__

#### Testing
 - Prob 2
 	- Automated tests will check return values of all template functions
	- With the exception of the function `display_hand`, automated tests will not check what is printed to screen. I will test that myself (and you should test it yourself as well!) Feel free to add whatever formatting or spacing you need to make the output to the screen look nice and readable.
